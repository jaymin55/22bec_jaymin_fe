    <h4>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h4>
    
    <!------ answer --------->
    <h3>answer</h3>

    <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, <br> making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, <br> making it easy to manage content from this end too.</p>
